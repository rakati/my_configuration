# my_configuration

This is the most configuration that I need during my studies

## docker set env
for the problem of session space docker can't be run in mac session for 1337 student
which they have only 5G in there session

so the solution is to use machine storage not session storage
the script for easier linking of files from goingfre which is machine storage
to session storage is above
